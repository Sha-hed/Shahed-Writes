# ShahedWrites Backend

## Description

Bike Store is a backend web application developed using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript. This project is designed to manage bike-related data through CRUD operations while maintaining a focus on data integrity and efficiency. The application utilizes Mongoose schemas for defining database models and Zod for robust data validation, ensuring secure and consistent data handling.

In addition to CRUD operations, the application supports order processing, where ordering a product adjusts inventory levels and tracks revenue generation. This feature is implemented using two Mongoose models: one for Product and another for Order, demonstrating seamless database relationships and efficient query handling.
